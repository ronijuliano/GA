LTD.,Full Time,Professional,Information Technology,"$3,600to$7,100",Monthly,"Who are we: Hubble is a technology startup focused on revolutionising the Construction Industry. The Construction industry undertakes the world’s largest, most expensive, and complex projects ever dreamt of by mankind. Yet, the Construction industry is notoriously slow to adopt new technologies and as a result, there exists a large amount of inefficiencies and problems that Hubble can create positive value and make a great impact on. This impacts the homes people live in, offices people work in, and cities generations live in. There is no other industry where technology can have a greater impact. Bar none. Hubble’s vision is to build the pillars of trust for the Construction industry and we are on a mission to develop the autonomous self-building construction sites of tomorrow - powered by big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.. Our first step to our mission is to track the Man, Machine, Material, and Money (4M) data - for the Construction industry. The 4M data can be used to optimise operations at the worksites as well as to build an automated trading platform for the 4M. We have grown rapidly to become the market leader in each of the 4M verticals: 1. Man: We have more than 10,000 construction workers (~5% market share) on Hubble's platform and have tracked more than 35 million man-hours in total. 2. Machine: We track more than 1.5 million machinery transactions/year and have >US$100 million worth of machinery on Hubble's platform today. 3. Material: We developed Hubble Maps (Patent Pending) for precise indoor material and man tracking. We were awarded BCA's Innovation Grant 2018 and presented our technology to DPM Teo Chee Hean. 4. Money: We are deployed at iconic projects such as Project Jewel, Paya Lebar Quarters, Gardens by the Bay, and City Gate and have tracked more than $1 billion in project value. Interesting fact: We have grown rapidly without any venture funding to become the market leader in this space in less than 1 year. Our partners include the largest and most prestigious Construction companies such as Woh Hup, Lum Chang, Hexacon, Erect Group, Koh Kock Leong Enterprise, Chuan Lim Construction, and OAS Painting and Construction. We have also built the best engineering, product, and business team comprising the best and brightest of Singapore. We are a collegial set up and are extremely collaborative.

Our strategic thrusts are in the spheres of intelligence, communications and media and our research capabilities are in shared sensor networks, public-public/public-private data-sharing platform, big data analytics and visualisation solutions. For more information about I²R, please visit www.i2r.a-star.edu.sg﻿ We are looking for strong candidates in the field of Artificial intelligence and deep learning, with an interest in working on both fundamental algorithms in large-scale machine learning or deep learning, and also applying it to practical problems in vertical domains. The position, based within the Program in Artificial Intelligence at I2R, entails working closely with a highly interdisciplinary team of researchers with training from leading universities like MIT, Stanford and CMU. Listed below are problems of interest in the Deep Learning 2.0 project: Multimodal Deep Learning: Towards effective learning from heterogeneous data sources Currently, deep learning is applied in various areas such as visual computing, speech recognition, text mining, etc. In each area, the learning model is trained with large amounts of data in isolation. A multimodal learning approach from heterogeneous data sources, including video, speech, text, etc. is necessary to achieve breakthrough in performance. Unsupervised Deep Learning: Towards 10X fewer labeled samples Labeling large amounts of training data is one of the most time-consuming steps in the deep learning pipeline, and is often not feasible. The aim is to achieve the same performance with 10x fewer labeled training samples. This is a strong step in the direction of unsupervised deep learning, where representations are learnt with large amounts of unlabeled unstructured data. Deep Learning on Embedded Devices: Towards 100X smaller models Current deep learning models have 10s of millions of neurons, making it infeasible for deployment on mobile and embedded hardware. The aim is to achieve models that are 100x smaller, with little loss in performance.

Our strategic thrusts are in the spheres of intelligence, communications and media and our research capabilities are in shared sensor networks, public-public/public-private data-sharing platform, big data analytics and visualisation solutions. For more information about I²R, please visit www.i2r.a-star.edu.sg We are looking for strong candidates in the field of Artificial intelligence and deep learning, with an interest in working on both fundamental algorithms in large-scale machine learning or deep learning, and also applying it to practical problems in vertical domains. The position, based within the Program in Artificial Intelligence at I2R, entails working closely with a highly interdisciplinary team of researchers with training from leading universities like MIT, Stanford and CMU. Listed below are problems of interest in the Deep Learning 2.0 project: Multimodal Deep Learning: Towards effective learning from heterogeneous data sources Currently, deep learning is applied in various areas such as visual computing, speech recognition, text mining, etc. In each area, the learning model is trained with large amounts of data in isolation. A multimodal learning approach from heterogeneous data sources, including video, speech, text, etc. is necessary to achieve breakthrough in performance. Unsupervised Deep Learning: Towards 10X fewer labeled samples Labeling large amounts of training data is one of the most time-consuming steps in the deep learning pipeline, and is often not feasible. The aim is to achieve the same performance with 10x fewer labeled training samples. This is a strong step in the direction of unsupervised deep learning, where representations are learnt with large amounts of unlabeled unstructured data. Deep Learning on Embedded Devices: Towards 100X smaller models Current deep learning models have 10s of millions of neurons, making it infeasible for deployment on mobile and embedded hardware. The aim is to achieve models that are 100x smaller, with little loss in performance. This capability will also be critical for emerging neuromorphic platforms, where the number of spiking neurons is orders of magnitude smaller than in current state-of-the-art deep learning models. Online Deep Learning: Towards Near Real Time (NRT) model updates State-of-the-art deep learning models still take several days to train on expensive GPU infrastructure.

LTD.,Full Time,"Manager, Fresh/entry level, Senior Executive",Information Technology,"$3,600to$7,100",Monthly,"Who are we: Hubble is a technology startup focused on revolutionising the Construction Industry. The Construction industry undertakes the world’s largest, most expensive, and complex projects ever dreamt of by mankind. Yet, the Construction industry is notoriously slow to adopt new technologies and as a result, there exists a large amount of inefficiencies and problems that Hubble can create positive value and make a great impact on. This impacts the homes people live in, offices people work in, and cities generations live in. There is no other industry where technology can have a greater impact. Bar none. Hubble’s vision is to build the pillars of trust for the Construction industry and we are on a mission to develop the autonomous self-building construction sites of tomorrow - powered by big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.. Our first step to our mission is to track the Man, Machine, Material, and Money (4M) data - for the Construction industry. The 4M data can be used to optimise operations at the worksites as well as to build an automated trading platform for the 4M. We have grown rapidly to become the market leader in each of the 4M verticals: 1. Man: We have more than 10,000 construction workers (~5% market share) on Hubble's platform and have tracked more than 35 million man-hours in total. 2. Machine: We track more than 1.5 million machinery transactions/year and have >US$100 million worth of machinery on Hubble's platform today. 3. Material: We developed Hubble Maps (Patent Pending) for precise indoor material and man tracking. We were awarded BCA's Innovation Grant 2018 and presented our technology to DPM Teo Chee Hean. 4. Money: We are deployed at iconic projects such as Project Jewel, Paya Lebar Quarters, Gardens by the Bay, and City Gate and have tracked more than $1 billion in project value.

The behavioral models in the long-term, agent-based simulator address household residential choice, vehicle availability, firm location and real-estate markets in a manner that is tightly integrated with an activity-based ‘mid-term’ model that estimates agent-specific ‘logsum’ accessibility measures for simulated daily activity patterns. The overall scope of FM research includes a number of projects on the development, and analysis of new and advanced forms of mobility options (such as on-demand mobility and autonomous vehicles), as well as on their urban planning and management implications.  Both FM, and the SMART Centre, encourage exploration of new ideas and the use of ‘big data’ to advance our understanding of behavioral choices, urban activity patterns and the adoption of new forms of mobility. Responsibilities Depending upon project assignment and postdoc skills and interests, the specific responsibilities will involve some combination of the following:  Enhancing, estimating and calibrating the behavioral models in the long-term simulator, Generating and updating synthetic populations of residents, firms, and workers for particular cities at various points in time, Performing complex data analysis and integration of geospatial datasets, Contributing to the design and initiation of new research projects and ideas related to household and firm behavior as new options evolve for urban mobility and freight delivery, Presenting research results at international workshops, conferences, and exhibits as well as at internal project meetings, Co-authoring articles for publication in top-tier, peer-reviewed journals and conferences, and Monitoring the progress of project components, supervising PhD students, and regularly meeting with Principle Investigators.

Incorporated in November 2014 in Singapore, the company is led by a core team with cumulative 30-years’ experience in finance, AI and big data analytics. Backed by institutional investors such as Jungle Ventures and Spring Seeds (a subsidiary of the Singapore Government), the company’s accolades include:   We are among the selected 21 companies which got accreditation from the government of Singapore for their stringent technology, finance and operations due diligence (www.imda.gov.sg/industry-development/programmes-and-grants/startups/accreditation-at-sgd)   We won the first place in the MAS FinTech Awards (Singapore SME) in the regulatory compliance space from the Monetary Authority of Singapore for our approach to make the workflows in AML and Reconciliation scalable and highly auditable (beyond ML based black box approach) (www.mas.gov.sg/News-and-Publications/Media-Releases/2016/Ten-FinTech-companies-recognised-for-innovative-solutions-at-inaugural-FinTech-Awards.aspx)   We are voted as one of the top 21 AI start-ups focusing on the financial services space by medici (www.letstalkpayments.com/medici-top-21-ai-companies/)   We graduated from Nomura's corporate innovation program in November 2017 where we successfully delivered our product – Reconciliation Management Suite – in a pilot environment (https://inc42.com/buzz/nomura-voyager-fintech-accelerator-voyager-demo-day/)     In regulatory compliance, we focus on anti-money laundering and reconciliation and our products – Alerts Management Suite (AMS) and Reconciliation Management Suite (RMS) – cater to these areas, respectively. The mission or goal is to achieve 40% operational efficiency with significant savings in infrastructure and operational costs. Tookitaki's unique selling proposition (USP) is in our approach where we combine our proprietary modelling technique with our complete auditable framework to make the process dynamic and highly explainable (moving out of the black box approach). Moreover, our flexible on-premise and cloud-packaging capabilities, along with the option of easy integration to exiting core-banking applications (REST API end points), make the solution deployment faster with lesser barrier to entry.
