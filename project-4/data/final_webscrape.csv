Our approach is relentless performance-oriented software engineering vs. server sprawl in our customers' datacentres. You will use the latest high-end hardware and continuously devise ways to push the envelope of software performance. We build in-house systems if we must. We had to for indexing 1M 60-column rows/s, for aggregating high throughput event streams over hundreds of combinations of dimensions, and for pattern matching 5M patterns at 100Gb/s per 2RU. We use these to solve real customer problems. You will experiment wildly. For example we implemented network monitoring using a GPU, and we tested 4-socket machines with 2T RAM. Our current favourite platform is a 2-socket system with Platinum 8180 CPUs (112 lcores in total), 4x40Gbps NICs and 1T RAM, which we use to process 160Gbps. You will help us build a successful software platform for the long run. We invest a lot in flexibility, such as with our extensible rule engine and declarative aggregation system that empowers our analysts and helps us minimise the C code we have to write for supporting disparate use-cases. We know the devil is in the details. You will improve performance through better memory allocation systems and better data structures, all while ensuring that they are integrated with Address Sanitizer and fully tested using unit tests and end-to-end regression tests. We work end-to-end. You will implement data engineering solutions that are both efficient and secure for handling events from 500 million users, and to extract insight without leaking individual information. We want to show off. To attract the best programmers we plan to showcase our technology. You can be part of our effort to open-source interesting pieces of our technology stack. Â  YOUR ROLE AS HIGH-PERFORMANCE DATA ENGINEER As a High-Performance Data Engineer, you will create and maintain tools, mainly in C, for crunching large amounts of data in files or streams. You will have to think both big, in terms of overall architecture, and small, in terms of low-level optimisations, to deliver solutions that are reusable, and match the performance of the best hardware. Every capability you add directly translates to new offerings made possible. Every percent of performance improvement directly translates to large cost savings.

Incorporated in November 2014 in Singapore, the company is led by a core team with cumulative 30-yearsâ experience in finance, AI and big data analytics. Backed by institutional investors such as Jungle Ventures and Spring Seeds (a subsidiary of the Singapore Government), the companyâs accolades include:  We are among the selected 21 companies which got accreditation from the government of Singapore for their stringent technology, finance and operations due diligence (www.imda.gov.sg/industry-development/programmes-and-grants/startups/accreditation-at-sgd) We won the first place in the MAS FinTech Awards (Singapore SME) in the regulatory compliance space from the Monetary Authority of Singapore for our approach to make the workflows in AML and Reconciliation scalable and highly auditable (beyond ML based black box approach) (www.mas.gov.sg/News-and-Publications/Media-Releases/2016/Ten-FinTech-companies-recognised-for-innovative-solutions-at-inaugural-FinTech-Awards.aspx) We are voted as one of the top 21 AI start-ups focusing on the financial services space by medici (www.letstalkpayments.com/medici-top-21-ai-companies/) We graduated from Nomura's corporate innovation program in November 2017 where we successfully delivered our product â Reconciliation Management Suite â in a pilot environment (https://inc42.com/buzz/nomura-voyager-fintech-accelerator-voyager-demo-day/)  In regulatory compliance, we focus on anti-money laundering and reconciliation and our products â Alerts Management Suite (AMS) and Reconciliation Management Suite (RMS) â cater to these areas, respectively. The mission or goal is to achieve 40% operational efficiency with significant savings in infrastructure and operational costs. Tookitaki's unique selling proposition (USP) is in our approach where we combine our proprietary modelling technique with our complete auditable framework to make the process dynamic and highly explainable (moving out of the black box approach). Moreover, our flexible on-premise and cloud-packaging capabilities, along with the option of easy integration to exiting core-banking applications (REST API end points), make the solution deployment faster with lesser barrier to entry. Today, regulatory compliance processes have become more complex and fluidic, increasing the chances for rule-based models to fail. Banks need to move beyond static rule-based systems and adopt a new approach to prevent financial and reputation loss. Tookitaki bridges the gap with its innovative software products â AMS, RMS and PMS.

LTD.,Full Time,Professional,Information Technology,3600to7100,Monthly,"Who are we: Hubble is a technology startup focused on revolutionising the Construction Industry. The Construction industry undertakes the worldâs largest, most expensive, and complex projects ever dreamt of by mankind. Yet, the Construction industry is notoriously slow to adopt new technologies and as a result, there exists a large amount of inefficiencies and problems that Hubble can create positive value and make a great impact on. This impacts the homes people live in, offices people work in, and cities generations live in. There is no other industry where technology can have a greater impact. Bar none. Hubbleâs vision is to build the pillars of trust for the Construction industry and we are on a mission to develop the autonomous self-building construction sites of tomorrow - powered by big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.. Our first step to our mission is to track the Man, Machine, Material, and Money (4M) data - for the Construction industry. The 4M data can be used to optimise operations at the worksites as well as to build an automated trading platform for the 4M. We have grown rapidly to become the market leader in each of the 4M verticals: 1. Man: We have more than 10,000 construction workers (~5% market share) on Hubble's platform and have tracked more than 35 million man-hours in total. 2. Machine: We track more than 1.5 million machinery transactions/year and have >US$100 million worth of machinery on Hubble's platform today. 3. Material: We developed Hubble Maps (Patent Pending) for precise indoor material and man tracking. We were awarded BCA's Innovation Grant 2018 and presented our technology to DPM Teo Chee Hean. 4. Money: We are deployed at iconic projects such as Project Jewel, Paya Lebar Quarters, Gardens by the Bay, and City Gate and have tracked more than $1 billion in project value. Interesting fact: We have grown rapidly without any venture funding to become the market leader in this space in less than 1 year. Our partners include the largest and most prestigious Construction companies such as Woh Hup, Lum Chang, Hexacon, Erect Group, Koh Kock Leong Enterprise, Chuan Lim Construction, and OAS Painting and Construction.

Incorporated in November 2014 in Singapore, the company is led by a core team with cumulative 30- yearsâ experience in finance, AI and big data analytics. Backed by institutional investors such as Jungle Ventures and Spring Seeds (a subsidiary of the Singapore Government), the companyâs accolades include:  ï· We are among the selected 21 companies which got accreditation from the government of Singapore for their stringent technology, finance and operations due diligence (www.imda.gov.sg/industry-development/programmes-and- grants/startups/accreditation-at-sgd)  ï· We won the first place in the MAS FinTech Awards (Singapore SME) in the regulatory compliance space from the Monetary Authority of Singapore for our approach to make the workflows in AML and Reconciliation scalable and highly auditable (beyond ML based black box approach) (www.mas.gov.sg/News-and- Publications/Media-Releases/2016/Ten-FinTech-companies-recognised-for- innovative-solutions-at-inaugural-FinTech-Awards.aspx)  ï· We are voted as one of the top 21 AI start-ups focusing on the financial services space by medici (www.letstalkpayments.com/medici-top-21-ai-companies/)  ï· We graduated from Nomura's corporate innovation program in November 2017 where we successfully delivered our product â Reconciliation Management Suite â in a pilot environment (https://inc42.com/buzz/nomura-voyager-fintech- accelerator-voyager-demo-day/)  In regulatory compliance, we focus on anti-money laundering and reconciliation and our products â Alerts Management Suite (AMS) and Reconciliation Management Suite (RMS) â cater to these areas, respectively. The mission or goal is to achieve 40% operational efficiency with significant savings in infrastructure and operational costs. Tookitaki's unique selling proposition (USP) is in our approach where we combine our proprietary modelling technique with our complete auditable framework to make the process dynamic and highly explainable (moving out of the black box approach). Moreover, our flexible on-premise and cloud-packaging capabilities, along with the option of easy integration to exiting core-banking applications (REST API end points), make the solution deployment faster with lesser barrier to entry. Today, regulatory compliance processes have become more complex and fluidic, increasing the chances for rule-based models to fail. Banks need to move beyond static rule-based systems and adopt a new approach to prevent financial and reputation loss.

LTD.,Permanent,Middle Management,Information Technology,12000to15000,Monthly,"Introducing Tookitaki Tookitaki is providing machine learning-powered enterprise solutions to address regulatory compliance problems in the financial services sector. Incorporated in November 2014 in Singapore, the company is led by a core team with cumulative 30-yearsâ experience in finance, AI and big data analytics. Backed by institutional investors such as Jungle Ventures and Spring Seeds (a subsidiary of the Singapore Government), the companyâs accolades include:   We are among the selected 21 companies which got accreditation from the government of Singapore for their stringent technology, finance and operations due diligence (www.imda.gov.sg/industry-development/programmes-and-grants/startups/accreditation-at-sgd)   We won the first place in the MAS FinTech Awards (Singapore SME) in the regulatory compliance space from the Monetary Authority of Singapore for our approach to make the workflows in AML and Reconciliation scalable and highly auditable (beyond ML based black box approach) (www.mas.gov.sg/News-and-Publications/Media-Releases/2016/Ten-FinTech-companies-recognised-for-innovative-solutions-at-inaugural-FinTech-Awards.aspx)   We are voted as one of the top 21 AI start-ups focusing on the financial services space by medici (www.letstalkpayments.com/medici-top-21-ai-companies/)   We graduated from Nomura's corporate innovation program in November 2017 where we successfully delivered our product â Reconciliation Management Suite â in a pilot environment (https://inc42.com/buzz/nomura-voyager-fintech-accelerator-voyager-demo-day/)   Â  In regulatory compliance, we focus on anti-money laundering and reconciliation and our products â Alerts Management Suite (AMS) and Reconciliation Management Suite (RMS) â cater to these areas, respectively. The mission or goal is to achieve 40% operational efficiency with significant savings in infrastructure and operational costs. Tookitaki's unique selling proposition (USP) is in our approach where we combine our proprietary modelling technique with our complete auditable framework to make the process dynamic and highly explainable (moving out of the black box approach). Moreover, our flexible on-premise and cloud-packaging capabilities, along with the option of easy integration to exiting core-banking applications (REST API end points), make the solution deployment faster with lesser barrier to entry. Today, regulatory compliance processes have become more complex and fluidic, increasing the chances for rule-based models to fail. Banks need to move beyond static rule-based systems and adopt a new approach to prevent financial and reputation loss.

Job Description To treat neurological patients, an in-depth analysis and understanding of patient-specific EEG is required and critical. However, visual inspection of EEG recordings is prohibitively time-consuming, and most hospitals do not have the personnel for this task. Automated algorithms to inspect EEG will allow us to analyse much larger volumes of EEG signals, in turn allowing us to build up a detailed database of waveforms associated with epilepsy and other neurological disorders. It has potential application in real-time seizure detection, non-expert EEG evaluation, and improved understanding of neurological disorders. We will develop deep learning methods for analysing EEG signals, which is an entirely new approach with much potential. Deep learning methods have consistently outperformed standard methods for speech and image analysis, and are expected to outshine existing methodologies also for biomedical signals and EEG in particular. In this project, we have the following aims: Aim1: To apply existing deep learning algorithms (CNN and LSTM recurrent networks) for the specific application of recognizing patterns in time series, and identify strengths and weaknesses of the existing algorithms. Aim2: To develop novel deep learning algorithms based on Bayesian variational inference and other approaches, for the specific application of recognizing patterns in time series.
