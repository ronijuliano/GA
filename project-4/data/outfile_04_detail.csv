At Google, we know that every employee has something important to say, and that every employee is integral to our success. We provide individually-tailored compensation packages that can be comprised of competitive salary, bonus, and equity components, along with the opportunity to earn further financial bonuses and rewards. Googlers thrive in small, focused teams and high-energy environments, believe in the ability of technology to change the world, and are as passionate about their lives as they are about their work. For more information, visit www.google.com/careers. The area: People Operations Great just isn't good enough for our People Operations team (you probably know us better as ""Human Resources""). Made up of equal parts HR professionals, former consultants, and analysts, we're the advocates of Google's colorful culture. In People Ops, we ""find them, grow them, and keep them"". We bring the world's most innovative people to Google and provide the programs that help them thrive.

The role: Compensation Operations Analyst, Google People Services - Singapore Our Googlers are innovative, take big risks and get things done, and our compensation plans are designed to reward them accordingly. On the leading edge of the compensation field, our team runs cyclical cash and equity programs and takes the notion of ""Total Rewards"" to new heights. We always aim to better recognize outstanding performance, so as a member of this team, you're an unconventional thinker and are willing to make bold bets. You take Googlers' feedback seriously, and collect it often to continually improve and enhance our programs through a two-way dialogue. Combining data and feedback from our Googlers with the latest industry research, you make large-scale, data-driven decisions that impact Googlers in a meaningful way. You'll find creative solutions to an assortment of compensation problems and manage related programs, ensuring their success and communicating findings with Googlers.
