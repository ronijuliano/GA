For more information about I²R, please visit www.i2r.a-star.edu.sg﻿ We are looking for strong candidates in the field of Artificial intelligence and deep learning, with an interest in working on both fundamental algorithms in large-scale machine learning or deep learning, and also applying it to practical problems in vertical domains. The position, based within the Program in Artificial Intelligence at I2R, entails working closely with a highly interdisciplinary team of researchers with training from leading universities like MIT, Stanford and CMU. Listed below are problems of interest in the Deep Learning 2.0 project: Multimodal Deep Learning: Towards effective learning from heterogeneous data sources Currently, deep learning is applied in various areas such as visual computing, speech recognition, text mining, etc. In each area, the learning model is trained with large amounts of data in isolation. A multimodal learning approach from heterogeneous data sources, including video, speech, text, etc. is necessary to achieve breakthrough in performance. Unsupervised Deep Learning: Towards 10X fewer labeled samples Labeling large amounts of training data is one of the most time-consuming steps in the deep learning pipeline, and is often not feasible. The aim is to achieve the same performance with 10x fewer labeled training samples. This is a strong step in the direction of unsupervised deep learning, where representations are learnt with large amounts of unlabeled unstructured data. Deep Learning on Embedded Devices: Towards 100X smaller models Current deep learning models have 10s of millions of neurons, making it infeasible for deployment on mobile and embedded hardware. The aim is to achieve models that are 100x smaller, with little loss in performance. This capability will also be critical for emerging neuromorphic platforms, where the number of spiking neurons is orders of magnitude smaller than in current state-of-the-art deep learning models. Online Deep Learning: Towards Near Real Time (NRT) model updates State-of-the-art deep learning models still take several days to train on expensive GPU infrastructure. A common problem is when new data (including new classes) are constantly added to an evolving, always-learning system. Algorithms to move towards real-time updates will be essential. Extreme Deep Learning: Training 1B neural networks efficiently The high model capacity of deep networks is why increasing amounts of data and model size improves performance. However, there are substantial challenges in hardware and algorithms challenges in training very large models efficiently. The aim is to address these challenges to achieve more efficient training. Deep Learning for Spoken Language Processing and Natural Language Understanding: Towards better modelling of human communication Language technology has made great advances through deep learning in the past five years, penetrating fields such as speech recognition and machine translation. However, there are still numerous challenges that need to be addressed, ranging from the requirement of specialized linguistic resources to large amounts of annotated data, and to insufficient theoretical grounding in deep learning. This aim attempts to address challenges that are often overlooked by major commercial AI players. White-Box Deep Learning: Towards interpretable and contextually informed models Current deep learning models are largely black-boxes that are not informed by contextual relations and provide little intuition. Improved abilities to regulate the learning process, and interpret the resulting predictions will be essential for the next wave of AI applications -- especially for complex learning scenarios and applications involving critical decisions. Incorporating Knowledge Graphs into Deep Learning: Towards better understanding of images Current deep learning systems today have no real understanding of images, with output typically a bunch of bounding boxes, learnt using a large number of label or sentence-level associations. Knowledge graphs like the MIT ConceptNet will be used to understand higher level semantics and relationships between entities, to improve classification accuracy.    ","Requirements   Minimum Bachelor in Computer Science, Statistics, or Data Science intensive fields, with expertise in one or more of the following areas:     Large-scale machine learning Deep learning, supervised or unsupervised Applying state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to practical problems in different domains   Experience in corporate or application oriented environments is a plus Ability to work independently, as well as in teams highly desired Good communication skills for proposals, reports, and publications Strong programming abilities (e.g. Perl, Bash, C/C++, Java, Python, R, MATLAB) Computer vision and deep learning skills desirable  The above eligibility criteria are not exhaustive.

TUMCREATE has received funding and support for the SPEEDCARGO project from the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) & the national Research Foundation (NRF) to develop automation solutions that will transform the Air Freight Logistics sector. The SPEEDCARGO solution will be the world's first AI-powered robotic solution for automatic build-up and break down of aviation cargo pallets and will help Singapore lead the transformation of the Logistics industry globally. The project is seeking technical experts with a passion for creating world class products, and a willingness to work in a fast paced, quality obsessed, multi-cultural global environment. On successful completion, the project will be spun off as a start-up with members of the project team having the option to join the start-up with benefits that include attractive ESOPs. Apply now if you are interested in working on cutting edge technologies, changing the world with your work and joining a dynamic start-up team. More details on the project: https://www.speedcargo.sg/   Background The design of real-world robotic systems is a multi-disciplinary effort. It involves the development of advanced perception systems, artificial intelligence based decision making, mechanical elements like sensors and actuators, electronic components for connecting and controlling the mechanical elements and software for higher-level planning and process control. This job profile focuses on development of specific computer vision modules for the perception system within SPEEDCARGO. It will involve the following specific task which the successful candidate will have to execute towards a real world working application.

Established in 1981, the SCHOOL OF ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING (EEE) is one of the founding Schools of the Nanyang Technological University. Built on a culture of excellence, the School is renowned for its high academic standards and strong tradition in research. To support teaching and cutting-edge research, EEE is host to 11 research centres and more than 50 laboratories, which are well-equipped with modern facilities and state-of-the-art equipment. With about 200 faculty members and an enrolment of more than 4,000, of which about 1,300 are graduate students, it is one of the largest EEE schools in the world. Job Description To treat neurological patients, an in-depth analysis and understanding of patient-specific EEG is required and critical. However, visual inspection of EEG recordings is prohibitively time-consuming, and most hospitals do not have the personnel for this task. Automated algorithms to inspect EEG will allow us to analyse much larger volumes of EEG signals, in turn allowing us to build up a detailed database of waveforms associated with epilepsy and other neurological disorders. It has potential application in real-time seizure detection, non-expert EEG evaluation, and improved understanding of neurological disorders. We will develop deep learning methods for analysing EEG signals, which is an entirely new approach with much potential. Deep learning methods have consistently outperformed standard methods for speech and image analysis, and are expected to outshine existing methodologies also for biomedical signals and EEG in particular. In this project, we have the following aims: Aim1: To apply existing deep learning algorithms (CNN and LSTM recurrent networks) for the specific application of recognizing patterns in time series, and identify strengths and weaknesses of the existing algorithms. Aim2: To develop novel deep learning algorithms based on Bayesian variational inference and other approaches, for the specific application of recognizing patterns in time series. Aim3:  To apply these deep learning algorithms for reliable EEG-based BCI classification and automatic detection of epileptic seizures from pediatric EEG (Physionet dataset).
